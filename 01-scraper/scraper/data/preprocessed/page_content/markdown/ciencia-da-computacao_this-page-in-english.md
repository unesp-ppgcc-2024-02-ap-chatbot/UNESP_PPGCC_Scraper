It offers studies in Applied Computing, which is divided in three research lines: Computing Systems, Information systems, and Computational Intelligence.

Our goal is to produce researchers in the lines offered by the program. This should be accomplished through the improvement in the students background, as well as their abilities in performing advanced research in computer science.

An interesting characteristic in this program is its multicampus structure. There are advisors coming from different cities (Bauru, Presidente Prudente, Rio Claro and São José do Rio Preto). The research work for the MSc or PhD courses should be executed in the campus where the advisor is.

From a candidate it is expected a strong knowledge in computing. Students coming from Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Information Technology majors are prefered, although good students from related majors who are interested in computer science are invited to enroll as well.
