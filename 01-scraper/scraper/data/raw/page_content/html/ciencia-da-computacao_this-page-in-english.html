The first  class started in march 2006. Nowadays it offers a Master of Science and PhD in Computer  Science.</p><p class="Texto">It offers studies in Applied Computing, which is divided in three research lines: Computing Systems, Information systems, and Computational Intelligence.</p><p class="Texto">Our goal is to produce researchers in the lines  offered by the program. This should be accomplished through the improvement in  the students background, as well as their abilities in performing advanced  research in computer science.</p><p class="Texto">An interesting characteristic in this program is  its multicampus structure. There are advisors coming from different cities  (Bauru, Presidente Prudente, Rio Claro and São José do Rio Preto). The research work for the MSc or PhD courses should be executed  in the campus where the advisor is.</p><p class="Texto">From a candidate it is expected a strong knowledge in computing. Students coming  from Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Information Technology majors  are prefered, although good students from related majors who are interested in  computer science are invited to enroll as well.</p><p class="Texto">Please, visit the <a href="#!/pos-graduacao/programas-de-pos-graduacao/ciencia-da-computacao/pessoas/docentes/" target="_blank">faculty page</a> to get more information about research lines and projects.</p></div>
