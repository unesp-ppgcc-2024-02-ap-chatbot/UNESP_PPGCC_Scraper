These areas comprise the following research  lines:</p><p>Â </p><p><span class="TituloDestaque1">Computer  Systems </span><br><br><strong><span class="txt_corpo">Computer Architecture and Distributed  Systems</span></strong></p><p class="txt_corpo">Projects inside this field are concerned with  topics such as hardware/software codesign, simulation and analysis of  distributed and parallel systems, computer networks, computer security,  performance analysis, cluster/grid/cloud computing and  virtualization.</p><p><br> <strong><span class="txt_corpo">Software Engineering and Databases</span></strong></p><p class="Texto">In this field projects are aimed to the development  of techniques and methodologies to support IT processes, systems development and  test. It also involves research about information manipulation, including  storage, retrieval and mining through innovative  databases.</p><p><br> <strong><span class="txt_corpo">Image Processing and Computer Vision</span></strong></p><p class="Texto">This research line comprise all levels of image  processing and pattern recognition. Research in this field involves the  application of neural networks and mathematical morphology. Projects inside this  area include projects developing pure digital signal processing techniques as  well as their application in specific problems such as medicine, biometry,  character recognition, etc.</p><p><br> <strong><span class="txt_corpo">Intelligent Systems</span></strong></p><p class="Texto">Work on this field comprises the development of  techniques to solve problems by the use of artifical intelligence. The main  methods here include approximate reasoning, multiagent systems and machine  learning. Applications of such techniques to other areas are also  researched.<br><br></p><p><span class="TituloDestaque1">Scientific  Computing </span><br><br><strong><span class="txt_corpo">Computational Mathematics</span></strong></p><p class="Texto">Computational mathematics is concerned with the  solving of complex problems through the use of computers. Here the studies  involve comptational geometry (finite elements), simulation, gravitation models,  criptographic models, and bioinspired computing.</p></div>
