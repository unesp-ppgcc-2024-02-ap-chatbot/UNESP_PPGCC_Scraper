These areas comprise the following research lines:

Â 

Computer Systems   
  
**Computer Architecture and Distributed Systems**

Projects inside this field are concerned with topics such as hardware/software codesign, simulation and analysis of distributed and parallel systems, computer networks, computer security, performance analysis, cluster/grid/cloud computing and virtualization.

  
 **Software Engineering and Databases**

In this field projects are aimed to the development of techniques and methodologies to support IT processes, systems development and test. It also involves research about information manipulation, including storage, retrieval and mining through innovative databases.

  
 **Image Processing and Computer Vision**

This research line comprise all levels of image processing and pattern recognition. Research in this field involves the application of neural networks and mathematical morphology. Projects inside this area include projects developing pure digital signal processing techniques as well as their application in specific problems such as medicine, biometry, character recognition, etc.

  
 **Intelligent Systems**

Work on this field comprises the development of techniques to solve problems by the use of artifical intelligence. The main methods here include approximate reasoning, multiagent systems and machine learning. Applications of such techniques to other areas are also researched.  
  


Scientific Computing   
  
**Computational Mathematics**

Computational mathematics is concerned with the solving of complex problems through the use of computers. Here the studies involve comptational geometry (finite elements), simulation, gravitation models, criptographic models, and bioinspired computing.
